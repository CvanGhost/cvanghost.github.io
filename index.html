          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I've just been playing with the page's .css file in the few recent days. And I honestly only forced myself to create this new post just to have at least two of them. I tried to use the pseudo class called "nth-child()". Now every even post should have a slightly darkger color. What is the exact color? That I can't tell you as I happened to be partially color-blind. However, it's RGB #F2F2F2 as far as I am concerned. </p>

            <p>The forthcoming text was just copy pasted form the self learning app called Mimo, which is pretty much the same like Duoling, but for coding languages. But I found this piece fo a text much more interesting than "Lorem ipsum". </p><p>If somebody would have told me a week ago that I would be able to make a website, I would not have believed them.</p>
            <p>Just a few days later, I came across <a href="https://getmimo.com">Mimo</a> (or m1m0) and started to work on a real blog.</p>
