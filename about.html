            <p>But I was not always this way. I was much worse. Feel free to check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">this</a> video to see how much.</p>
            <p class="post-date">17th of February 2020</p>
            <p>Alright, now some more serious stuff to reward you for the effor you made by visiting this humble blog.</p>
            <p>I studied an IT + economics on secondary school in a small town called Orlová located in southern Czech republic. I don't remember almost any economics from it and forgot a lot of the boring IT fundamentals I learned there as well. I hated networking as I really did not like both the teachers we had for this subject. Frankly it was not much of their fault. I almost failed my maturity exam as I picked networking for the verbal part (The question was "WAN and ISP technologies") and knew little to nothing about it. As soon as the teachers realized this sad fact, they started to ask me about theory from all the other remaining question I actualy did study for. As I knew almost everything from the other areas I managed to leave with 4 and completed the whole exam. Few months later I started working for a company that focused on WAN and ISP technologies. What an irony</p>
            <p>In recent months I moved to a different part of the country and started working for a small financial company in a small team responsible for its LAN network. So now it's my 6th year working in networking field. Am I an expert in this field after that much years? Do you like the job? Nope and nope. Not exactly sure why. I like the job at the current company due to the benefits it has. For example home office and flexible working hours. This little thing really does a lot. But being tied to the physical place is something I started to struggle with lately. I really don't see myself in such an environment in next 5 years (A qeustion you often receive in an interview in bigger companies.) I desire to work on myself, be as flexible as I want. Find the way to earn exactly as much money I necessarily need with less time spent making them. And I really need to enjoy that time making the money. When you work full time, you actually spent third of your time working, right? And if you are not enjoying it, you are kind of wasting "third" of your life. This is how I feel about it. </p>
            <p>That little amount of the above thext is a small intro to the reason why this web presentation actually came to existence. I am now trying to refresh all the HTML and CSS knowledge I used to have. I'm already learning to code in JavaScript and then will try to move to React .js library.</p>
